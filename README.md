# agentsh

> **macOS note:** Native macOS enforcement via ESF (Endpoint Security Framework) + NE (Network Extension) is in **Alpha**. It works end-to-end — file, process, and network events flow through the system extension to the Go policy engine — but expect rough edges and breaking changes between releases. For production use today, we recommend Linux.
>
> **Windows note:** We are working to get the minifilter drivers signed. Until then, only Windows WSL2 mode is fully supported for production use.

**Secure, policy-enforced execution gateway for AI agents.**

agentsh sits *under* your agent/tooling—intercepting **file**, **network**, **process**, and **signal** activity (including subprocess trees), enforcing the policy you define, and emitting **structured audit events**.

> **Platform note:** Linux provides full enforcement (100% security score). macOS **ESF+NE** (90% score) is in **Alpha** — functional but not production-ready. Windows **WSL2** provides full Linux-equivalent enforcement (100% score); native Windows via minifilter driver + **AppContainer** (85% score) is pending driver signing. See the [Platform Comparison Matrix](docs/platform-comparison.md) for details.

## What is agentsh?

- **Drop-in shell/exec endpoint** that turns every command (and its subprocesses) into auditable events.
- **Per-operation policy engine**: `allow`, `deny`, `approve` (human OK), `soft_delete`, or `redirect`.
- **Full I/O visibility**:
  - file open/read/write/delete
  - network connect + DNS
  - process start/exit
  - PTY activity
  - LLM API requests with DLP and usage tracking
  - Postgres-family database traffic through declared `db_services`
  - signal send/block (Linux enforced, macOS/Windows audit)
  - database queries via the embedded **PostgreSQL proxy** — per-statement classification and policy
  - Route outbound HTTP API calls through declared services (**http_services**) with per-method, per-path rules, approval gating, and fail-closed host enforcement
- **Two output modes**:
  - human-friendly shell output
  - compact JSON responses for agents/tools

---

## Why agentsh?

Agent workflows eventually run arbitrary code (`pip install`, `make test`, `python script.py`). Traditional "ask for approval before running a command" controls stop at the tool boundary and can't see what happens *inside* that command.

agentsh enforces policy **at runtime**, so hidden work done by subprocesses is still governed, logged, and (when required) approved.

---

## Meaningful blocks: deny → redirect (the "steering" superpower)

Most systems can *deny* an action. agentsh can also **redirect** it.

That means when an agent tries the wrong approach (or brute-force workarounds), policy can steer it to the right path by swapping the command and returning guidance—keeping the agent on the paved road and reducing wasted retries.

**Example: redirect curl to an audited wrapper**

```yaml
command_rules:
  - name: redirect-curl
    commands: [curl, wget]
    decision: redirect
    message: "Downloads routed through audited fetch"
    redirect_to:
      command: agentsh-fetch
      args: ["--audit"]
```

**Example: redirect writes outside workspace back inside**

```yaml
file_rules:
  - name: redirect-outside-writes
    paths: ["/home/**", "/tmp/**"]
    operations: [write, create]
    decision: redirect
    redirect_to: "/workspace/.scratch"
    message: "Writes outside workspace redirected to /workspace/.scratch"
```

The agent sees a successful operation (not an error), but you control where things actually land.

---

## Containers + agentsh: better together

Containers isolate the host surface; agentsh adds **in-container runtime visibility and policy**.

- Per-operation audit (files, network, commands) shows what happened during installs/builds/tests.
- Approvals and rules persist across long-lived shells and subprocess trees—not just the first command.
- Path-level controls on mounted workspaces/caches/creds; containers don't natively give that granularity.
- Same behavior on host and in containers, so CI and local dev see the same policy outcomes.

---

## Quick start

### Install

**macOS (Homebrew)**

```bash
brew tap canyonroad/tap
brew install --cask agentsh
```

This installs the AgentSH app bundle with the ESF+NE system extension. After installation you'll be prompted to approve the system extension in **System Settings > General > Login Items & Extensions**.

**Linux (from a GitHub Release)**

Download the `.deb`, `.rpm`, or `.apk` for your platform from the [releases page](https://github.com/erans/agentsh/releases).

```bash
# Example for Debian/Ubuntu
sudo dpkg -i agentsh_<VERSION>_linux_amd64.deb
```

**From source (Linux)**

```bash
make build
sudo install -m 0755 bin/agentsh bin/agentsh-shell-shim /usr/local/bin
```

**From source (macOS)**

```bash
# ESF+NE mode (full enforcement — Alpha, requires Xcode 15+)
make build-macos-enterprise
```

See [macOS Build Guide](docs/macos-build.md) for detailed macOS build instructions.

---

### Run locally

```bash
# Start the server (optional if using autostart)
./bin/agentsh server --config configs/server-config.yaml

# Create a session and run a command (shell output)
SID=$(./bin/agentsh session create --workspace . --json | jq -r .id)
./bin/agentsh exec "$SID" -- ls -la

# Structured output for agents
./bin/agentsh exec --output json --events summary "$SID" -- curl https://example.com
```

---

### Check what gets enforced

`agentsh detect` probes the host and reports which enforcement primitives are actually available — seccomp, Landlock, FUSE, eBPF, ptrace, cgroups — grouped into per-domain protection scores plus the selected security mode. On restricted hosts (Daytona, E2B, Firecracker-class) where the seccomp user-notify listener can't install, it reports the mode that will *actually* enforce rather than what the kernel merely supports.

```bash
agentsh detect              # human-readable protection report
agentsh detect config       # emit a config tuned for this host
```

See [Security Modes](docs/security-modes.md) for the mode matrix and tuning knobs.

---

### Tell your agent to use it (AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md snippet)

```md
## Shell access

- Run commands via agentsh, not directly in bash/zsh.
- Use: `agentsh exec $SID -- <your-command-here>`
- For structured output: `agentsh exec --output json --events summary $SID -- <your-command-here>`
- Get session ID first: `SID=$(agentsh session create --workspace . --json | jq -r .id)`
```

---

### Autostart (no manual daemon step)

You do **not** need to start `agentsh server` yourself.

* The first `agentsh exec` (or any shimmed `/bin/sh`/`/bin/bash`) will automatically launch a local server using `configs/server-config.yaml` (or `AGENTSH_CONFIG` if set).
* That server keeps the FUSE layer and policy engine alive for the session lifetime; subsequent commands reuse it.
* Set `AGENTSH_NO_AUTO=1` if you want to manage the server lifecycle manually.

---

## Policy model

### Decisions

* `allow`
* `deny`
* `approve` (human OK)
* `redirect` (swap a command)
* `audit` (allow + log)
* `soft_delete` (quarantine deletes with restore)

### Scopes

* file operations
* commands
* environment vars
* network (DNS/connect)
* database (SQL statements via the PostgreSQL proxy)
* PTY/session settings
* declared HTTP services

### Evaluation

* **first matching rule wins**

Rules live in a named policy; sessions choose a policy.

Defaults:

* sample config: `configs/server-config.yaml`
* default policy: `configs/policies/default.yaml`
* env override: set `AGENTSH_POLICY_NAME` to an **allowed** policy name (no suffix). If unset/invalid/disallowed, the default is used.
* env policy: configure `policies.env_policy` (allow/deny, max_bytes, max_keys, block_iteration) and per-command `env_*` overrides in policy files. Empty allowlist defaults to minimal PATH/LANG/TERM/HOME with built-in secret deny list; set `block_iteration` to hide env iteration (requires env shim).
* allowlist: configure `policies.allowed` in `config.yml`; empty means only the default is permitted.
* optional integrity: set `policies.manifest_path` to a SHA256 manifest to verify policy files at load time.

### Environment policy quick reference

- **Defaults:** With no `env_allow`, agentsh builds a minimal env (PATH/LANG/TERM/HOME) and strips built-in secret keys.
- **Overrides:** Per-command `env_allow`/`env_deny` plus `env_max_keys`/`env_max_bytes` cap and filter the child env at exec time.
- **Block iteration:** `env_block_iteration: true` (global or per rule) hides env enumeration; set `policies.env_shim_path` to `libenvshim.so` so agentsh injects `LD_PRELOAD` + `AGENTSH_ENV_BLOCK_ITERATION=1`.
- **Limits:** Errors if limits are exceeded; env builder is applied before exec for every command.
- **env_inject:** Operator-trusted environment variables injected into all commands, bypassing policy filtering. Primary use: `BASH_ENV` to disable shell builtins that bypass seccomp. Configure in `sandbox.env_inject` (global) or policy-level `env_inject` (overrides global).
- **Examples:** See `config.yml` and policy samples under `configs/`.

### Example rules (trimmed)

```yaml
version: 1
name: default

file_rules:
  - name: allow-workspace
    paths: ["/workspace", "/workspace/**"]
    operations: [read, open, stat, list, write, create, mkdir, chmod, rename]
    decision: allow

  - name: approve-workspace-delete
    paths: ["/workspace", "/workspace/**"]
    operations: [delete, rmdir]
    decision: approve
    message: "Delete {{.Path}}?"
    timeout: 5m

  - name: deny-ssh-keys
    paths: ["/home/**/.ssh/**", "/root/.ssh/**"]
    operations: ["*"]
    decision: deny

network_rules:
  - name: allow-api
    domains: ["api.example.com"]
    ports: [443]
    decision: allow

command_rules:
  - name: block-dangerous
    commands: ["rm", "shutdown", "reboot"]
    decision: deny
```

---

### Using a policy

```bash
# Start the server with your policy
./bin/agentsh server --config configs/server-config.yaml

# Create a session pinned to a policy
SID=$(./bin/agentsh session create --workspace /workspace --policy default --json | jq -r .id)

# Exec commands; responses include decision + guidance when blocked/approved
./bin/agentsh exec "$SID" -- rm -rf /workspace/tmp
```

### Authentication

agentsh supports multiple authentication methods:

| Type | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| `api_key` | Simple deployments with static keys |
| `oidc` | Enterprise SSO (Okta, Azure AD, etc.) |
| `hybrid` | Both methods accepted |

**Approval modes** for human-in-the-loop verification:
- `local_tty` - Terminal prompt (default)
- `totp` - Authenticator app codes
- `webauthn` - Hardware security keys (YubiKey)
- `api` - Remote approval via REST

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for configuration details.

### MCP Security

- **Tool Whitelisting**: Control which MCP tools can be invoked via allowlist/denylist policies
- **Version Pinning**: Detect tool definition changes (rug pull protection) with configurable responses
- **Cross-Server Detection**: Block data exfiltration patterns (read from Server A → send via Server B)
- **Rate Limiting**: Token bucket rate limiting for MCP servers and network domains

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for full configuration options, or run the **[MCP Protection Demo](https://github.com/canyonroad/agentsh-mcp-protection-demo)** to see these detections in action.

## 60-second demo

The fastest way to "get it" is to run something that spawns subprocesses and touches the filesystem/network.

```bash
# 1) Create a session in your repo/workspace
SID=$(agentsh session create --workspace . --json | jq -r .id)

# 2) Run something simple (human-friendly output)
agentsh exec "$SID" -- uname -a
# → prints system info, just like normal

# 3) Run something that hits the network (JSON output + event summary)
agentsh exec --output json --events summary "$SID" -- curl -s https://example.com
# → JSON response includes: exit_code, stdout, and events[] showing dns_query + net_connect

# 4) Trigger a policy decision - try to delete something
agentsh exec "$SID" -- rm -rf ./tmp
# → With default policy: prompts for approval or denies based on your rules

# 5) See what happened (structured audit trail)
agentsh exec --output json --events all "$SID" -- ls
# → events[] shows every file operation, even from subprocesses
```

**What you'll see in the JSON output:**
- `exit_code`: the command's exit status
- `stdout` / `stderr`: captured output
- `events[]`: every file/network/process operation with policy decisions
- `policy.decision`: `allow`, `deny`, `approve`, or `redirect`

Tip: keep a terminal with `--output json` open when testing policies—it makes it obvious what's being touched.

---

### Session Reports

Generate markdown reports summarizing session activity:

```bash
# Quick summary
agentsh report latest --level=summary

# Detailed investigation
agentsh report <session-id> --level=detailed --output=report.md
```

Reports include:
- Decision summary (allowed, blocked, redirected)
- Automatic findings detection (violations, anomalies)
- Activity breakdown by category
- Full event timeline (detailed mode)

See [CI/CD Integration Guide](docs/cicd-integration.md) for pipeline examples.

---

### Workspace Checkpoints

Create snapshots of workspace state for recovery from destructive operations:

```bash
# Create a checkpoint before risky operations
agentsh checkpoint create --session $SID --workspace /workspace --reason "before cleanup"

# List checkpoints for a session
agentsh checkpoint list --session $SID

# Show what changed since a checkpoint
agentsh checkpoint show <cp-id> --session $SID --workspace /workspace --diff

# Preview what rollback would restore (dry-run)
agentsh checkpoint rollback <cp-id> --session $SID --workspace /workspace --dry-run

# Restore workspace to checkpoint state
agentsh checkpoint rollback <cp-id> --session $SID --workspace /workspace

# Clean up old checkpoints
agentsh checkpoint purge --session $SID --older-than 24h --keep 5
```

**Auto-checkpoint:** When enabled, agentsh automatically creates checkpoints before risky commands (`rm`, `mv`, `git reset`, `git checkout`, etc.). Configure in `sessions.checkpoints.auto_checkpoint`.

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md#checkpoint-and-rollback) for full configuration options.

---

### LLM Proxy and DLP

agentsh includes an embedded proxy that intercepts all LLM API requests from agents:

```bash
# Check proxy status for a session
agentsh proxy status <session-id>

# View LLM-specific events
agentsh session logs <session-id> --type=llm
```

**Features:**
- **Automatic routing**: Sets `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` and `OPENAI_BASE_URL` so agent SDKs route through the proxy
- **Custom providers**: Route to LiteLLM, Azure OpenAI, vLLM, or corporate gateways
- **DLP redaction**: PII (emails, phone numbers, API keys, etc.) is redacted before reaching LLM providers
- **Custom patterns**: Define organization-specific patterns for sensitive data
- **Usage tracking**: Token counts extracted and logged for cost attribution
- **Audit trail**: All requests/responses logged to session storage

**Provider configuration:**

```yaml
proxy:
  mode: embedded
  providers:
    anthropic: https://api.anthropic.com    # Default Anthropic API
    openai: https://api.openai.com          # Default OpenAI API

    # Or use alternative providers:
    # openai: http://localhost:8000         # LiteLLM / vLLM
    # openai: https://your-resource.openai.azure.com  # Azure OpenAI
    # anthropic: https://llm.corp.example.com         # Corporate gateway
```

**DLP configuration:**

```yaml
dlp:
  mode: redact
  patterns:
    email: true
    api_keys: true
  custom_patterns:
    - name: customer_id
      display: identifier
      regex: "CUST-[0-9]{8}"
```

See [LLM Proxy Documentation](docs/llm-proxy.md) for full configuration options.

The same proxy also dispatches declared `http_services` entries — named API upstreams with per-method, per-path rules. See [Declared HTTP Services](docs/llm-proxy.md#declared-http-services) and the [HTTP Services Cookbook](docs/cookbook/http-services.md) for details.

---

### Database Access Control (Postgres only today)

agentsh can enforce policy on declared database services through `db_services`, `database_connection_rules`, and `database_rules`. The current implementation is Postgres-family only: PostgreSQL is the supported target, with Aurora Postgres using the same path and Redshift/CockroachDB treated as Postgres-compatible dialects with beta coverage. MySQL, MongoDB, Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks, ClickHouse, MSSQL, Cassandra, Redis, and Oracle are roadmap items, not current runtime support.

Current Postgres support includes:
- Connection allow/deny/approve/audit decisions.
- Statement classification for PostgreSQL wire protocol v3, including Simple Query, Extended Query, SQL prepared statements, COPY, FunctionCall denial, transaction state, and CancelRequest mapping.
- Strict per-object policy coverage with deny precedence.
- Catalog-backed relation/function selectors for resolved-object policies.
- Safe runtime `redirect` for read-only Postgres relation replacement.
- Bypass detection and real-Postgres Docker E2E coverage in CI.

The Postgres proxy runtime is Linux-only in-process code today. Use native Linux, WSL2, or a Linux VM environment for database enforcement.

See [Database Access Control](docs/agentsh-db-access-spec.md) and [Policy documentation](docs/operations/policies.md#database-access-policies-postgres-only-today).

---

### Policy Generation

Generate restrictive policies from observed session behavior ("profile-then-lock" workflow):

```bash
# Generate policy from latest session
agentsh policy generate latest --output=ci-policy.yaml

# Generate with custom name and threshold
agentsh policy generate abc123 --name=production-build --threshold=10

# Quick preview to stdout
agentsh policy generate latest
```

The generated policy:
- Allows only operations observed during the session
- Groups paths into globs when many files in same directory
- Collapses subdomains into wildcards (e.g., `*.github.com`)
- Flags risky commands (curl, wget, rm) with arg patterns
- Includes blocked operations as commented-out rules for review

**Use cases:**
- **CI/CD lockdown**: Profile a build/test run, lock future runs to that behavior
- **Agent sandboxing**: Let an AI agent run a task, generate policy for future runs
- **Container profiling**: Profile a workload, generate minimal policy for production

---

## Database Access (PostgreSQL)

agentsh includes an embedded **PostgreSQL proxy** that makes database access agent-aware and policy-governed. It speaks the Postgres wire protocol, classifies every statement into a list of *effects* (reads, writes, DDL, DCL, transaction/session control, bulk `COPY`/export, …), and evaluates each effect against `database_rules` before forwarding upstream — so an `UPDATE`, `DROP`, or unscoped `DELETE` is governed the same way a file write or network connect is.

- **Per-effect, multi-object evaluation** — rules are collect-all / **any-deny-wins** (the most-restrictive verb decides), not first-match.
- **Decisions:** `allow`, `deny`, `approve` (human OK), `audit`, and statement-level `redirect`.
- **`require_where` guard** — refuse top-level `UPDATE`/`DELETE` that lack a `WHERE` clause.
- **Connection-level rules** (`database_connection_rules`) gate which sessions may reach which declared `db_service`.
- **Auth + statement audit events** for every connection and query; statement-text logging is configurable (`policies.db.log_statements: none | parameters_redacted | full`).

Phase 1 covers the PostgreSQL v3 wire protocol (dialects: `postgres`, `aurora_postgres`; `redshift` / `cockroachdb` in beta). Replication and GSSAPI-encrypted connections default-deny.

```yaml
database_rules:
  # normal reads + updates on the declared service
  - name: app-read-and-update
    db_service: appdb
    operations: [READ, UPDATE]
    decision: allow

  # allow UPDATE/DELETE only when scoped by a WHERE clause
  - name: app-guard-unscoped-dml
    db_service: appdb
    operations: [UPDATE, DELETE]
    require_where: true
    decision: allow

  # block schema/DDL mutations; terminate the transaction on violation
  - name: app-deny-ddl
    db_service: appdb
    operations: [CREATE, DROP, ALTER, EXPORT]
    decision: deny
    deny_mode_in_tx: terminate
    message: "appdb is read+update only. Requested: {{.Operation}}"
```

See the [Database Access Control spec](docs/agentsh-db-access-spec.md) for the full operation taxonomy, effects model, connection rules, and unavoidability threat model.

---

## Network Redirect

agentsh can transparently redirect DNS and TCP connections, enabling use cases like routing API calls through corporate proxies or switching AI providers without code changes.

### DNS Redirect

Intercept DNS resolution and return configured IP addresses:

```yaml
dns_redirect:
  - match: "api.anthropic.com"
    redirect_ip: "10.0.0.50"
    visibility: audit_only
    on_failure: fail_closed

  - match: ".*\\.openai\\.com"    # Regex pattern
    redirect_ip: "10.0.0.51"
    visibility: warn
```

### Connect Redirect

Redirect TCP connections to different destinations with optional TLS handling:

```yaml
connect_redirect:
  - match: "api.anthropic.com:443"
    redirect_to: "vertex-proxy.internal:8443"
    tls_mode: passthrough          # Forward encrypted traffic unchanged
    visibility: silent

  - match: "api.openai.com:443"
    redirect_to: "azure-proxy.internal:443"
    tls_mode: rewrite_sni          # Modify SNI in TLS ClientHello
    rewrite_sni: "azure-openai.example.com"
    visibility: audit_only
```

### Options

| Field | Values | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `visibility` | `silent`, `audit_only`, `warn` | How redirects are logged/shown |
| `on_failure` | `fail_closed`, `fail_open`, `retry_original` | What happens if redirect fails |
| `tls_mode` | `passthrough`, `rewrite_sni` | TLS handling for connect redirect |

### Platform Support

| Feature | Linux | macOS | Windows |
|---------|-------|-------|---------|
| DNS Redirect | ✅ eBPF | ✅ pf/proxy | ✅ WinDivert |
| Connect Redirect | ✅ eBPF | ✅ pf/proxy | ✅ WinDivert |
| SNI Rewrite | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

### Use Cases

- **API Gateway Routing**: Route Anthropic/OpenAI calls through corporate LLM gateway
- **Provider Switching**: Redirect Claude API to GCP Vertex AI or Azure OpenAI
- **Testing**: Redirect production APIs to mock servers
- **Compliance**: Force all LLM traffic through audit proxies

---

## Signal Filtering

agentsh intercepts signals (`kill`, `SIGTERM`, etc.) sent between processes, providing policy-based control over which signals can reach which targets.

### Platform Support

| Platform | Blocking | Redirect | Audit |
|----------|----------|----------|-------|
| Linux | Yes (seccomp user-notify) | Yes | Yes |
| macOS | No | No | Yes (ES) |
| Windows | Partial | No | Yes (ETW) |

### Example Signal Rules

```yaml
signal_rules:
  # Allow signals to self and children
  - name: allow-self
    signals: ["@all"]
    target:
      type: self
    decision: allow

  - name: allow-children
    signals: ["@all"]
    target:
      type: children
    decision: allow

  # Redirect SIGKILL to graceful SIGTERM
  - name: graceful-kill
    signals: ["SIGKILL"]
    target:
      type: children
    decision: redirect
    redirect_to: SIGTERM

  # Block fatal signals to external processes
  - name: deny-external-fatal
    signals: ["@fatal"]
    target:
      type: external
    decision: deny
```

### Signal Groups

- `@all` - All signals (1-31)
- `@fatal` - SIGKILL, SIGTERM, SIGQUIT, SIGABRT
- `@job` - SIGSTOP, SIGCONT, SIGTSTP, SIGTTIN, SIGTTOU
- `@reload` - SIGHUP, SIGUSR1, SIGUSR2

### Target Types

- `self` - Process signaling itself
- `children` - Direct child processes
- `descendants` - All descendant processes
- `session` - Any process in the agentsh session
- `external` - PIDs outside the session
- `system` - PID 1 and kernel threads

See [Policy Documentation](docs/operations/policies.md#signal-rules) for full configuration options.

---

## macOS File I/O Monitoring

On macOS, agentsh monitors file I/O using the Endpoint Security Framework (ESF), subscribing to both AUTH and NOTIFY events. Tracked operations include file open, create, delete, rename, write (detected via close-modified), and on macOS 26+, chmod and chown via attribute change events. Every file event is attributed to the originating session and command through PID-based resolution, providing full audit trails across subprocess trees.

ESF provides kernel-level allow/deny enforcement but does not support transparent file interception like Linux FUSE. Policy actions that require interception -- such as `redirect` (path rewriting) and `soft_delete` (quarantine) -- are implemented as deny + guidance: the operation is blocked at the ESF level and the agent receives instructions to retry with the correct path or to acknowledge that the file is protected. See the [macOS ESF+NE architecture doc](docs/macos-esf-ne-architecture.md) for event stream details and the [policy documentation](docs/operations/policies.md#file-rule-actions-on-macos-esf) for per-action behavior.

---

## Starter policy packs

You already have a default policy (`configs/policies/default.yaml`). These opinionated packs are available as separate files so teams can pick one:

* **[`policies/dev-safe.yaml`](configs/policies/dev-safe.yaml)**: safe for local development
  * allow workspace read/write
  * approve deletes in workspace
  * deny `~/.ssh/**`, `/root/.ssh/**`
  * restrict network to allowlisted domains/ports

* **[`policies/ci-strict.yaml`](configs/policies/ci-strict.yaml)**: safe for CI runners
  * deny anything outside workspace
  * deny outbound network except artifact registries
  * deny interactive shells unless explicitly allowed
  * audit everything (summary events)

* **[`policies/agent-sandbox.yaml`](configs/policies/agent-sandbox.yaml)**: "agent runs unknown code" mode
  * default deny + explicit allowlist
  * approve any credential/path access
  * redirect network tool usage to internal proxies/mirrors
  * soft-delete destructive operations for easy recovery
